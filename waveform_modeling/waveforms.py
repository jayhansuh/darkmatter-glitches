Waveform Modeling Module:
Contains functions for modeling theoretical gravitational waveforms from dark matter particle decays.

This module provides placeholder implementations for generating gravitational-wave strain time series
resulting from hypothetical dark matter particle decay events or dark matter clump passages. The waveforms
are modeled using different physical assumptions (e.g., gravitational quadrupole radiation, recoil signals,
and Gaussian burst approximations).

Functions:
- simulate_quadrupole_waveform: Model GW strain via quadrupole formula for a dark matter decay.
- simulate_recoil_waveform: Model GW strain as a recoil (kick) from anisotropic dark matter decay.
- simulate_gaussian_burst_waveform: Approximate GW strain as a short Gaussian "blip" burst.
All functions return a time array and a strain array representing the waveform.

Example:
>>> t, h = simulate_gaussian_burst_waveform(particle_mass=1e-10, distance=1e6, ...)
>>> # t and h are numpy arrays of equal length representing time (s) and strain (dimensionless).

Note:
These implementations are placeholders; actual physics-based calculations (e.g., integrating the quadrupole moment or solving the Einstein field equations for the scenario) must be added by researchers.

def simulate_quadrupole_waveform(particle_mass: float, distance: float, decay_fraction: float, sampling_rate: float = 4096.0):
    """
    Simulate a gravitational-wave strain time series from a dark matter particle decay using a quadrupole radiation model.
    
    This function models the gravitational wave signal assuming the dark matter particle decays into multiple pieces with some asymmetry, 
    generating gravitational radiation via the quadrupole formula. The signal is expected to be a short burst ("blip") as the decay happens rapidly.
    
    Args:
        particle_mass (float): Mass of the dark matter particle (in kilograms or solar masses units) that decays.
        distance (float): Distance from Earth to the decay event (in meters or parsecs).
        decay_fraction (float): Fraction of mass-energy released asymmetrically (dimensionless 0-1). 
                                This represents how asymmetric the decay is (0 means symmetric no GW, closer to 1 means highly asymmetric).
        sampling_rate (float, optional): Sampling rate for the time series (in Hz, samples per second). Default is 4096.0 Hz.
        
    Returns:
        tuple: (time_array, strain_array) where:
            - time_array (np.ndarray): 1D array of time values (seconds) for the waveform.
            - strain_array (np.ndarray): 1D array of strain values (dimensionless) at those times.
        
    Modeling approach:
        Uses the quadrupole radiation formula to estimate strain: h ~ (2G/rc^4) * (d^2Q/dt^2), 
        where Q is the mass quadrupole moment of the system. 
        For a simple model, we assume the particle decays into two unequal masses, producing a transient quadrupole moment. 
        The waveform is approximated as a damped sinusoid or burst whose amplitude scales with (particle_mass * decay_fraction) and falls off with distance.
        
        In a more detailed model, one would compute the second time derivative of the mass distribution during the decay. 
        For now, this function returns a placeholder waveform (e.g., a Gaussian-modulated sinusoid or simple narrow pulse).
    
    Scientific context:
        Dark matter particle decays could produce a sudden redistribution of mass-energy, emitting a gravitational wave. 
        If the decay is not perfectly symmetric, a gravitational wave "blip" might be emitted. 
        This method approximates that signal. According to theoretical models, a passing dark matter clump or decay can induce gravitational strain in a detector primarily via Newtonian gravitational attraction of the test masses and the Shapiro time delay effect on the laser, with the Newtonian component typically dominating.

def simulate_recoil_waveform(particle_mass: float, distance: float, kick_velocity: float, sampling_rate: float = 4096.0):
    """
    Simulate a gravitational-wave strain from a dark matter particle decay as a recoil (kick) event.
    
    This function assumes that when the dark matter particle decays, the decay products receive a recoil (like a rocket effect) due to asymmetric emission of energy or particles. 
    The sudden change in momentum can generate a burst of gravitational waves. 
    The waveform is modeled as a short transient corresponding to the recoil acceleration profile.
    
    Args:
        particle_mass (float): Mass of the decaying dark matter particle (in kg or solar mass units).
        distance (float): Distance to the event (in meters or parsecs).
        kick_velocity (float): Characteristic velocity of recoil imparted to the system (m/s).
        sampling_rate (float, optional): Sampling rate for time series (Hz). Default 4096 Hz.
    
    Returns:
        tuple: (time_array, strain_array) representing the time series of the gravitational-wave strain.
    
    Modeling approach:
        We approximate the recoil signal as a single-cycle burst. For instance, a rapid acceleration and deceleration can be represented 
        by a half-sine or triangular impulse in the strain. The amplitude of the strain is related to the change in momentum (particle_mass * kick_velocity) 
        and inversely to the distance.
        
        For example, one could model the strain ~ (G/c^4) * (momentum_change / distance) * some temporal window function. Here we provide a placeholder 
        where the strain is represented by a half-sine pulse with amplitude scaled by particle_mass and kick_velocity.
    
    Scientific context:
        Anisotropic decay or collision of dark matter could impart a recoil to the system, emitting gravitational waves. 
        If such an event occurred near a LIGO detector, it might manifest as a short "blip" glitch in the strain data.

    """
    Simulate a gravitational-wave "blip" as a Gaussian burst waveform.
    
    This function generates a short Gaussian-shaped transient in strain, which serves as an approximation for a generic short gravitational wave burst. 
    It can be used as a simple model for signals from dark matter particle decays or unexplained blip glitches.
    
    Args:
        particle_mass (float): Effective mass scale of the dark matter event (this can scale the amplitude).
        distance (float): Distance to the dark matter event (in appropriate units, e.g., meters; amplitude scales as 1/distance).
        burst_width (float, optional): Standard deviation of the Gaussian burst in seconds. Default is 0.01 s (10 ms).
        sampling_rate (float, optional): Sampling rate for the time series (Hz). Default is 4096 Hz.
    
    Returns:
        tuple: (time_array, strain_array) of the Gaussian burst waveform.
    
    Modeling approach:
        The strain is modeled as h(t) = A * exp(-0.5 * ((t - t0)/burst_width)^2), where t0 is the center time of the burst, and A is an amplitude 
        determined by particle_mass and distance (e.g., A ~ particle_mass / distance * some constant factor). 
        This yields a single-peaked burst. We center the burst in the time array.
    
    Scientific context:
        Blip glitches in LIGO are very short duration transients. If a dark matter particle decay produces a gravitational perturbation, it might appear similar to a blip glitch - a quick spike in strain. 
        This simple Gaussian model is often used as a proxy for unmodeled burst signals in gravitational wave data analysis.
